				<h1> Python</h1>
				<p> Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It's widely used in various fields, including web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and more. Here’s a brief introduction to its key features and concepts:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<h2>Easy to Learn</h2>
					</li>
					<p>Python’s syntax is clean and straightforward, making it an excellent choice for beginners. It emphasizes readability, allowing new programmers to grasp concepts quickly.</p>
				</ul>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<h2> Interpreted Language</h2>
					</li>
					<p>Python is an interpreted language, meaning that code is executed line by line. This makes debugging easier since you can test small snippets of code without compiling.</p>
				</ul>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<h2>Dynamic Typing</h2>
					</li>
					<p>    In Python, you don’t need to declare the type of a variable when you create it. This dynamic typing allows for more flexibility but requires careful handling of variable types.</p>
				</ul>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<h2>Rich Libraries and Frameworks</h2>
					</li>
					<p>Python has a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks that extend its capabilities. Some popular ones include:<br>
					<ol type="i">
    						<li>NumPy for numerical computations</li>
   					 	<li>Pandas for data manipulation and analysis</li>
    						<li>Matplotlib for data visualization</li>
    						<li>Django and Flask for web development</li>
    						<li>TensorFlow and PyTorch for machine learning</li>
    					</ol>
    				</ul>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<h2>Community and Support</h2>
					</li>
					<p>Python has a large, active community, which means extensive documentation, tutorials, and forums are available for support. This makes it easier to find help and resources for learning.</p>
				</ul>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<h2>Cross-Platform Compatibility</h2>
					</li>
					<p>Python runs on various platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux. You can write your code once and run it anywhere without modifications.</p>
				</ul>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<h2>Basic Syntax</h2>
					</li>
					<ol type="i">
						<li>Variables and Data Types</li>
						<li>Control Structures</li>
						<li>Functions</li>
					</ol>
				</ul>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<h2>Getting Started</h2>
					</li>
					<p>To start coding in Python, you can download it from the official website. Alternatively, many online platforms like Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, or Replit allow you to code in Python directly in your browser.</p>
