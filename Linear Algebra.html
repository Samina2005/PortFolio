				<h1> Linear Algebra </h1>
				<p> Linear Algebra is a branch of mathematics that deals with vectors,vector spaces,and linear transformations between these spaces. It is fundamental to various areas of mathematics,physics, engineering,computer science,and more. Here's an overview of key concepts: </p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<h2> Vectors </h2>
					</li>
					<ol>
						<h3> Definition </h3> 
						<p> A vector is an ordered list of numbers.For example, in a 3 dimensional space a vector could be v=(v1,v2,v3), Where each vi is a component of vector.</p>
					</ol>
					<ol>
						<h3> Operations </h3> 
						<p> Vectors can be added, subtracted, and multiplied by scalars.Two important vector operation include:</p>
						<ol type="i">
							<li> 
								<h4> Dot Product</h4>
								<p> v.w=v1w1+v2w2+v3w3, which gives a scalar.</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<h4> Cross Product </h4>
								<p> For 3D vectors, the cross product v cross w gives another vector orthogonal to both.</p>
							</li>
							
				       		 </ol>
				       	</ol>
				</ul>
			        <ul>
			       		<li>
						<h2> Matrices</h2>
					</li>
					<p>A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers arranged in rows and columns. Matrices can represent systems of linear equations and transformations of vectors. For example, a m×nm×n matrix has mm rows and nn columns.</p>
				</ul>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<h2> linear Transformation </h2>
					</li>
				        <p>    A linear transformation is a function between vector spaces that preserves vector addition and scalar multiplication. For a transformation T from vector space V to vector space W, it holds that:<br>
    T(u+v)=T(u)+T(v)<br>
    T(u+v)=T(u)+T(v)<br>
    T(cu)=cT(u)<br>
    T(cu)=cT(u)<br>

where u and v are vectors in V, and c is a scalar.</p>
				</ul>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<h2> Systems of Linear Equations</h2>
						<p>A system of linear equations can be expressed in matrix form as Ax=bAx=b, where AA is a matrix of coefficients, xx is the vector of variables, and bb is the vector of constants. Solutions can be found using methods like Gaussian elimination or matrix inverses.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<h2> Determinants</h2>
						<p>The determinant is a scalar value that can be computed from a square matrix. It provides important properties of the matrix, such as whether it is invertible. A matrix is invertible if and only if its determinant is non-zero.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<h2>Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors</h2>

    						<p>An eigenvector of a matrix A is a non-zero vector v such that when A multiplies v, the output is a scalar multiple of v:<br>
  						 Av=λv<br>
   						 Av=λv<br>
						where λ is the eigenvalue associated with the eigenvector v.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<h2>Applications</h2>

    						<p>Linear algebra has applications in various fields, including physics, engineering, computer science (especially in graphics and machine learning), economics, and more. It's essential 		for understanding concepts like transformations, dimensionality reduction, and optimization.</p>
    					</li>
    				</ul>
    				<ul>
    					<li>
    						<h2>Conclusion</h2>
    						<p>Linear algebra is a foundational mathematical discipline with broad applications. Understanding its principles allows for deeper insights into various scientific and engineering problems.</p>
